### Purpose of this repo:

All the code you will find within this repo was written over the course of two weeks while at the CodeBoxx bootcamp.

We spent one week designing the logic of each program through pseudo code, we spent the next week implementing the logic of a residential elevator controller in
Javascript, Python and a "bonus" of Ruby for those who still had time, which I managed to complete. The program had to manage two elevators.

The final week involved compiled languages and we were asked to design a commercial elevator controller for high rise buildings. The program now had to manage 20 elevators.
The commercial program had to be written in C# and Go and additional "points" were offered to those that could also implement the program in Java and Elixir. This week was certainly the most challenging one to date as I had never used any of these languages in the past. In the end, I was able to successfully implement the algorithm in C#, Java, Go and partly in Elixir.

Elixir was especially challenging as it is a newer language (though it is based on Erlang which is a few decades old) and doesn't have as much documentation as the Javascripts of the world - Not to mention the fact that it is based around functional programming which is a paradigm I did not know a lot about. After several failures and a lot of team work, I was able to implement a very basic Elixir algorithm. It is not able to go through all the scenarios we were given but still, it's something!
